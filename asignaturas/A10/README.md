# A10 - Intelligent agents and multi-agent systems

Multiagent systems are systems consisting of several autonomous entities called agents that interact among themselves in order to solve problems that exceed the individual capabilities of each or solving them in a more efficient way. This interaction is the main object of research in multiagent systems, and it has contributed to different disciplines such as Social Science, Game Theory and Artificial Intelligence. In this module, besides studying these contributions, we will introduce the students to the practice of research in any area related to multi-agent systems, and the preparation of papers describing the results of its research activity.
