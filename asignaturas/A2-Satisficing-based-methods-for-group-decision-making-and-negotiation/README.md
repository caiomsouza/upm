# A2: Satisficing-based Methods for Group Decision Making and Negotiation

In this module, “satisficing” logic is presented as the rational framework for negotiation analysis and collective decision making. This framework will appear as the ideal one to strengthen the link between both of these disciplines of decision analysis.
The way to implement satisficing logic, both to a preference aggregation problem and to a negotiation analysis problem, will be through the use of Goal Programming.
