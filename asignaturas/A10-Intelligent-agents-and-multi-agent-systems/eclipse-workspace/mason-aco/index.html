<h2>Ant System (AS)</h2> 
By Nik Swoboda
</table>

<p>A simulation of AS using the Extended Double Bridge graph and search
for the shortest path as the testbed.  All edges are considered to be of
the same length, and each edge is desplayed with its current pheromone
level.</p>
<p>The algorithm was implemented based upon the description in
<i>Ant Colony Optimization - Artificial Ants as a Computational
Intelligence Technique</i> by Dorigo, Birattari and St&uuml;tzle; the
graph comes from that appearing the book <i>Ant Colony Optimization</i>
by Dorigo and St&uuml;tzle.</p>
